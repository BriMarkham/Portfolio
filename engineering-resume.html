        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>With over a decade of experience in the nuclear submarine industry, I am a seasoned engineer with a passion for safety, quality, and innovation. I have worked as a shipyard liaison engineer at Knolls Atomic Power Lab, where I was responsible for coordinating and overseeing the defueling of multiple nuclear submarine cores each year, ensuring compliance with key performance indicators and milestones.</p>
        <p>As a shipyard liaison engineer, I leveraged my skills in communication, problem solving, and leadership to work effectively with remote shipyards, vendors, and customers. I developed and facilitated training and mentorship for shipyard and laboratory personnel on reactor operations and nuclear safety, creating a more competent and well-trained workforce. I also led cross-functional teams on LEAN and Six Sigma initiatives to streamline processes and procedures locally and at the shipyards, saving man-years of effort and training each year. Additionally, I contributed to the design of a new generation of VR training platforms that would save the program millions of dollars and enhance the safety and quality of the defueling operations.</p>
